## What is it that we want to build?
The client wants a meal planning application that can plan a meal schedule for the user, generate a shopping list based on recipe choices. The meals suggested by the application should be retrieved from a database. The application should also be able to receive a new recipe from the user and save it into the database.

## For whom?
The application is intended for families or individuals who want suggestions and meal planning for the week/month. Additionally, it caters to an audience that wants a structured shopping list to ensure the necessary ingredients for a meal plan.

## Why?
This will make everyday life easier for parents and students. It would create more structure in their daily routines and prevent a lot of food waste. In addition to saving time, users would also be able to track their nutritional intake in terms of calories, micronutrients, and possibly macronutrients.
